Statement of Data Access:
The data provided here may not be made public until June 1st 2022.

Abstract:

These conductivity, temperature, and depth data were collected as part of the 2022 International Year of the Salmon Pan-Pacific Winter High Seas Expedition conducted from January-April 2022 utilizing 5 different research/fishing vessels. The objective of this expedition was to demonstrate the utility of an international pan-Pacific winter ecosystem survey to understand how increasingly extreme climate variability in the North Pacific Ocean and the associated changes in the physical environment influence the abundance, distribution, migration, and growth of Pacific salmon and surrounding species. This dataset includes salinity, fluorescence, oxygen, collected on a SBE-911plus CTD

Protocols:

CTD Data has been quality controlled using Seabird standard software, to convert, calculate/derive and bin data.  PMEL-EcoFOCI scientists provide final Quality Assurance by visually inspecting the data, correcting for offsets/spikes caused by known discrepancies as noted in logs, and applying calibration offsets (oxygen, salinity).  For this dataset, Oxygens have been calibrated to the field Winkler oxygens.  No calibration correction was needed or applied for salinities.

Scripts:
standardized names and events where manually adjusted from original data, and sigmat was calculated with code snippet included.
